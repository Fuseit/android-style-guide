# 1. Android Studio Guide

## 1.1 Android SDK

Place your [Android SDK](https://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/index.html?pkg=tools) somewhere in your home directory or some other application-independent location. Some IDEs include the SDK when installed, and may place it under the same directory as the IDE. This can be bad when you need to upgrade (or reinstall) the IDE, or when changing IDEs. Also avoid putting the SDK in another system-level directory that might need sudo permissions, if your IDE is running under your user and not under root.

## 1.2 Build System

Your default option should be [Gradle](http://tools.android.com/tech-docs/new-build-system). Ant is much more limited and also more verbose. With Gradle, it's simple to:

- Build different flavours or variants of your app
- Make simple script-like tasks
- Manage and download dependencies
- Customize keystores
- And more

Android's Gradle plugin is also being actively developed by Google as the new standard build system.

# 2. Project Guide

## 2.1 Project Structure

There are two popular options: the old Ant & Eclipse ADT project structure, and the new Gradle & Android Studio project structure. At Fuse we use the new structure.

Old structure:

```
old-structure
├─ assets
├─ libs
├─ res
├─ src
│  └─ com/fuse/project
├─ AndroidManifest.xml
├─ build.gradle
├─ project.properties
└─ proguard-rules.pro
```

New structure:

```
new-structure
├─ library-foobar
├─ app
│  ├─ libs
│  ├─ src
│  │  ├─ androidTest
│  │  │  └─ java
│  │  │     └─ com/fuse/project
│  │  └─ main
│  │     ├─ java
│  │     │  └─ com/fuse/project
│  │     ├─ res
│  │     └─ AndroidManifest.xml
│  ├─ build.gradle
│  └─ proguard-rules.pro
├─ build.gradle
└─ settings.gradle
```

The main difference is that the new structure explicitly separates 'source sets' (`main`, `androidTest`), a concept from Gradle. You could, for instance, add source sets 'paid' and 'free' into `src` which will have source code for the paid and free flavours of your app.

Having a top-level `app` is useful to distinguish your app from other library projects (e.g., `library-foobar`) that will be referenced in your app. The `settings.gradle` then keeps references to these library projects, which `app/build.gradle` can reference to.

## 2.2 Gradle Configuration

**General structure.** Follow [Google's guide on Gradle for Android](http://tools.android.com/tech-docs/new-build-system/user-guide)

**Small tasks.** Instead of (shell, Python, Perl, etc) scripts, you can make tasks in Gradle. Just follow [Gradle's documentation](http://www.gradle.org/docs/current/userguide/userguide_single.html#N10CBF) for more details.

**Passwords.** In your app's `build.gradle` you will need to define the `signingConfigs` for the release build. Here is what you should avoid:

_Don't do this_. This would appear in the version control system.

```groovy
signingConfigs {
    release {
        storeFile file("myapp.keystore")
        storePassword "password123"
        keyAlias "thekey"
        keyPassword "password789"
    }
}
```

Instead, make a `gradle.properties` file which should _not_ be added to the version control system:

```
KEYSTORE_PASSWORD=password123
KEY_PASSWORD=password789
```

That file is automatically imported by gradle, so you can use it in `build.gradle` as such:

```groovy
signingConfigs {
    release {
        try {
            storeFile file("myapp.keystore")
            storePassword KEYSTORE_PASSWORD
            keyAlias "thekey"
            keyPassword KEY_PASSWORD
        }
        catch (ex) {
            throw new InvalidUserDataException("You should define KEYSTORE_PASSWORD and KEY_PASSWORD in gradle.properties.")
        }
    }
}
```

**Prefer Maven dependency resolution instead of importing jar files.** If you explicitly include jar files in your project, they will be of some specific frozen version, such as `2.1.1`. Downloading jars and handling updates is cumbersome, this is a problem that Maven solves properly, and is also encouraged in Android Gradle builds. For example:

```groovy
dependencies {
    compile 'com.squareup.okhttp:okhttp:2.2.0'
    compile 'com.squareup.okhttp:okhttp-urlconnection:2.2.0'
}
```    

**Avoid Maven dynamic dependency resolution**
Avoid the use of dynamically versioned, such as `2.1.+` as this may result in different and unstable builds or subtle, untracked differences in behavior between builds. The use of static versions such as `2.1.1` helps create a more stable, predictable and repeatable development environment.

## 2.3 Proguard Configuration

[ProGuard](http://proguard.sourceforge.net/) is normally used on Android projects to shrink and obfuscate the packaged code.

Whether you are using ProGuard or not depends on your project configuration. Usually you would configure gradle to use ProGuard when building a release apk.

```groovy
buildTypes {
    debug {
        minifyEnabled false
    }
    release {
        signingConfig signingConfigs.release
        minifyEnabled true
        proguardFiles getDefaultProguardFile('proguard-android.txt'), 'proguard-rules.pro'
    }
}
```

In order to determine which code has to be preserved and which code can be discarded or obfuscated, you have to specify one or more entry points to your code. These entry points are typically classes with main methods, applets, midlets, activities, etc.
Android framework uses a default configuration which can be found from `SDK_HOME/tools/proguard/proguard-android.txt`. Using the above configuration, custom project-specific ProGuard rules, as defined in `my-project/app/proguard-rules.pro`, will be appended to the default configuration.

A common problem related to ProGuard is to see the application crashing on startup with `ClassNotFoundException` or `NoSuchFieldException` or similar, even though the build command (i.e. `assembleRelease`) succeeded without warnings.
This means one out of two things:

1. ProGuard has removed the class, enum, method, field or annotation, considering it's not required.
2. ProGuard has obfuscated (renamed) the class, enum or field name, but it's being used indirectly by its original name, i.e. through Java reflection.

Check `app/build/outputs/proguard/release/usage.txt` to see if the object in question has been removed.
Check `app/build/outputs/proguard/release/mapping.txt` to see if the object in question has been obfuscated.

In order to prevent ProGuard from *stripping away* needed classes or class members, add a `keep` options to your ProGuard config:
```
-keep class com.fuse.project.MyClass { *; }
```

To prevent ProGuard from *obfuscating* classes or class members, add a `keepnames`:
```
-keepnames class com.fuse.project.MyClass { *; }
```

Check [this template's ProGuard config](https://github.com/futurice/android-best-practices/blob/master/templates/rx-architecture/app/proguard-rules.pro) for some examples.
Read more at [Proguard](http://proguard.sourceforge.net/#manual/examples.html) for examples.

**Early on in your project, make a release build** to check whether ProGuard rules are correctly keeping whatever is important. Also whenever you include new libraries, make a release build and test the apk on a device. Don't wait until your app is finally version "1.0" to make a release build, you might get several unpleasant surprises and a short time to fix them.

**Tip.** Save the `mapping.txt` file for every release that you publish to your users. By retaining a copy of the `mapping.txt` file for each release build, you ensure that you can debug a problem if a user encounters a bug and submits an obfuscated stack trace.

**DexGuard**. If you need hard-core tools for optimizing, and specially obfuscating release code, consider [DexGuard](http://www.saikoa.com/dexguard), a commercial software made by the same team that built ProGuard. It can also easily split Dex files to solve the 65k methods limitation.

## 2.4 Activities and Fragments

There is no consensus among the community nor Fuse developers how to best organize Android architectures with Fragments and Activities. Square even has [a library for building architectures mostly with Views](https://github.com/square/mortar), bypassing the need for Fragments, but this still is not considered a widely recommendable practice in the community.

Because of Android API's history, you can loosely consider Fragments as UI pieces of a screen. In other words, Fragments are normally related to UI. Activities can be loosely considered to be controllers, they are specially important for their lifecycle and for managing state. However, you are likely to see variation in these roles: activities might be take UI roles ([delivering transitions between screens](https://developer.android.com/about/versions/lollipop.html)), and [fragments might be used solely as controllers](http://developer.android.com/guide/components/fragments.html#AddingWithoutUI). We suggest to sail carefully, taking informed decisions since there are drawbacks for choosing a fragments-only architecture, or activities-only, or views-only. Here are some advices on what to be careful with, but take them with a grain of salt:

- Avoid using [nested fragments](https://developer.android.com/about/versions/android-4.2.html#NestedFragments) extensively, because [matryoshka bugs](http://delyan.me/android-s-matryoshka-problem/) can occur. Use nested fragments only when it makes sense (for instance, fragments in a horizontally-sliding ViewPager inside a screen-like fragment) or if it's a well-informed decision.
- Avoid putting too much code in activities. Whenever possible, keep them as lightweight containers, existing in your application primarily for the lifecycle and other important Android-interfacing APIs. Prefer single-fragment activities instead of plain activities - put UI code into the activity's fragment. This makes it reusable in case you need to change it to reside in a tabbed layout, or in a multi-fragment tablet screen. Avoid having an activity without a corresponding fragment, unless you are making an informed decision.
- Don't abuse Android-level APIs such as heavily relying on Intent for your app's internal workings. You could affect the Android OS or other applications, creating bugs or lag. For instance, it is known that if your app uses Intents for internal communication between your packages, you might incur multi-second lag on user experience if the app was opened just after OS boot.
- Pay special attention to UI re-creation and be sure you handle that scenario properly. Keep in mind that the UI might be destroyed for various reasons (e.g. app put in background, layout orientation change)
- Do not rely on custom constructors for Fragments and Activities. These should __always__ have default constructors available to ensure the OS can re-create then when necessary.

## 2.6 Java Packages Architecture

Java architectures for Android applications can be roughly approximated in [Model-View-Controller](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller). In Android, [Fragment and Activity are actually controller classes](http://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=2126865). On the other hand, they are explicity part of the user interface, hence are also views.

For this reason, it is hard to classify fragments (or activities) as strictly controllers or views. It's better to let them stay in their own `fragments` package. Activities can stay on the top-level package as long as you follow the advice of the previous section. If you are planning to have more than 2 or 3 activities, then make also an `activities` package.

Otherwise, the architecture can look like a typical MVC, with a `models` package containing POJOs to be populated through the JSON parser with API responses, and a `views` package containing your custom Views, notifications, action bar views, widgets, etc. Adapters are a gray matter, living between data and views. However, they typically need to export some View via `getView()`, so you can include the `adapters` subpackage inside `views`.

Some controller classes are application-wide and close to the Android system. These can live in a `managers` package. Miscellaneous data processing classes, such as "DateUtils", stay in the `utils` package. Classes that are responsible for interacting with the backend stay in the `network` package.

All in all, ordered from the closest-to-backend to the closest-to-the-user:

```
com.fuse.project
├─ network
├─ models
├─ managers
├─ utils
├─ fragments
└─ views
   ├─ adapters
   ├─ actionbar
   ├─ widgets
   └─ notifications
```

## 2.6 Data Storage

### 2.6.1 Shared Preferences

If you only need to persist simple flags and your application runs in a single process SharedPreferences is probably enough for you. It is a good default option.

There are two reasons why you might not want to use SharedPreferences:

* *Performance*: Your data is complex or there is a lot of it
* *Multiple processes accessing the data*: You have widgets or remote services that run in their own processes and require synchronized data

### 2.6.2 Content Providers

In the case SharedPreferences is not enough for you, you should use the platform standard ContentProviders, which are fast and process safe.

The single problem with ContentProviders is the amount of boilerplate code that is needed to set them up, as well as low quality tutorials. It is possible, however, to generate the ContentProvider by using a library such as [Schematic](https://github.com/SimonVT/schematic), which significantly reduces the effort.

You still need to write some parsing code yourself to read the data objects from the Sqlite columns and vice versa. It is possible to serialize the data objects, for instance with Gson, and only persist the resulting string. In this way you lose in performance but on the other hand you do not need to declare a column for all the fields of the data class.

# 3. File Naming

## 3.1 Class Files
Class names are written in [UpperCamelCase](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CamelCase).

For classes that extend an Android component, the name of the class should end with the name of the component; for example: `SignInActivity`, `SignInFragment`, `ImageUploaderService`, `ChangePasswordDialog`.

## 3.2 Resources Files

Resources file names are written in __lowercase_underscore__.

### 3.2.1 Drawable Files

Naming conventions for drawables:


| Asset Type   | Prefix            |		Example               |
|--------------| ------------------|-----------------------------|
| Action bar   | `ab_`             | `ab_stacked.9.png`          |
| Button       | `btn_`	            | `btn_send_pressed.9.png`    |
| Dialog       | `dialog_`         | `dialog_top.9.png`          |
| Divider      | `divider_`        | `divider_horizontal.9.png`  |
| Icon         | `ic_`	            | `ic_star.png`               |
| Menu         | `menu_	`           | `menu_submenu_bg.9.png`     |
| Notification | `notification_`	| `notification_bg.9.png`     |
| Tabs         | `tab_`            | `tab_pressed.9.png`         |

Naming conventions for icons (taken from [Android iconography guidelines](http://developer.android.com/design/style/iconography.html)):

| Asset Type                      | Prefix             | Example                      |
| --------------------------------| ----------------   | ---------------------------- |
| Icons                           | `ic_`              | `ic_star.png`                |
| Launcher icons                  | `ic_launcher`      | `ic_launcher_calendar.png`   |
| Menu icons and Action Bar icons | `ic_menu`          | `ic_menu_archive.png`        |
| Status bar icons                | `ic_stat_notify`   | `ic_stat_notify_msg.png`     |
| Tab icons                       | `ic_tab`           | `ic_tab_recent.png`          |
| Dialog icons                    | `ic_dialog`        | `ic_dialog_info.png`         |

Naming conventions for selector states:

| State	       | Suffix          | Example                     |
|--------------|-----------------|-----------------------------|
| Normal       | `_normal`       | `btn_order_normal.9.png`    |
| Pressed      | `_pressed`      | `btn_order_pressed.9.png`   |
| Focused      | `_focused`      | `btn_order_focused.9.png`   |
| Disabled     | `_disabled`     | `btn_order_disabled.9.png`  |
| Selected     | `_selected`     | `btn_order_selected.9.png`  |

### 3.2.2 Layout Files

Layout files should match the name of the Android components that they are intended for but moving the top level component name to the beginning. For example, if we are creating a layout for the `SignInActivity`, the name of the layout file should be `activity_sign_in.xml`.

| Component        | Class Name             | Layout Name                   |
| ---------------- | ---------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Activity         | `UserProfileActivity`  | `activity_user_profile.xml`   |
| Fragment         | `SignUpFragment`       | `fragment_sign_up.xml`        |
| Dialog           | `ChangePasswordDialog` | `dialog_change_password.xml`  |
| AdapterView item | ---                    | `item_person.xml`             |
| Partial layout   | ---                    | `partial_stats_bar.xml`       |

A slightly different case is when we are creating a layout that is going to be inflated by an `Adapter`, e.g to populate a `ListView`. In this case, the name of the layout should start with `item_`.

Note that there are cases where these rules will not be possible to apply. For example, when creating layout files that are intended to be part of other layouts. In this case you should use the prefix `partial_`.

### 3.2.3 Menu Files

Similar to layout files, menu files should match the name of the component. For example, if we are defining a menu file that is going to be used in the `UserActivity`, then the name of the file should be `activity_user.xml`

A good practice is to not include the word `menu` as part of the name because these files are already located in the `menu` directory.

### 3.2.4 Values Files

Resource files in the values folder should be __plural__, e.g. `strings.xml`, `styles.xml`, `colors.xml`, `dimens.xml`, `attrs.xml`

# 4 Code Guidelines

## 4.1 Java Language Rules

### 4.1.1 Don't Ignore Exceptions

You must never do the following:

```java
void setServerPort(String value) {
    try {
        serverPort = Integer.parseInt(value);
    } catch (NumberFormatException e) { }
}
```

_While you may think that your code will never encounter this error condition or that it is not important to handle it, ignoring exceptions like above creates mines in your code for someone else to trip over some day. You must handle every Exception in your code in some principled way. The specific handling varies depending on the case._ - ([Android code style guidelines](https://source.android.com/source/code-style.html))

See alternatives [here](https://source.android.com/source/code-style.html#dont-ignore-exceptions).

### 4.1.2 Don't Catch Generic Exception

You should not do this:

```java
try {
    someComplicatedIOFunction();        // may throw IOException
    someComplicatedParsingFunction();   // may throw ParsingException
    someComplicatedSecurityFunction();  // may throw SecurityException
    // phew, made it all the way
} catch (Exception e) {                 // I'll just catch all exceptions
    handleError();                      // with one generic handler!
}
```

See the reason why and some alternatives [here](https://source.android.com/source/code-style.html#dont-catch-generic-exception)

### 4.1.3 Don't Use Finalizers

_We don't use finalizers. There are no guarantees as to when a finalizer will be called, or even that it will be called at all. In most cases, you can do what you need from a finalizer with good exception handling. If you absolutely need it, define a `close()` method (or the like) and document exactly when that method needs to be called. See `InputStream` for an example. In this case it is appropriate but not required to print a short log message from the finalizer, as long as it is not expected to flood the logs._ - ([Android code style guidelines](https://source.android.com/source/code-style.html#dont-use-finalizers))

### 4.1.4 Fully Qualify Imports

This is bad: `import foo.*;`

This is good: `import foo.Bar;`

See more info [here](https://source.android.com/source/code-style.html#fully-qualify-imports)

### 4.1.5 Override equals and hashCode carefully
This corresponds to Items 7 and 8 in Effective Java (2nd edition). 
- The first item explaines that it's very difficult to extend an instantiable class and add state to the derived class without breaking the _equals()_ contract.
- The second item requires _equals()_ and _hashCode()_ to be overriden together. The reason is to ensure that the classes in question will work properly with hash-based collections, which use both _hashCode()_ and _equals()_.

### 4.1.6 Use generics properly
Avoid using raw types when dealing with generics. This should be obvious as it prevents type-safety checks. The only acceptable usage of raw types is when dealing with improperly written (or really old) third party libraries.

Secondly, perfer writing generic code to non-generic code. Whenever it's possible and the extra effort/code isn't considerable, generic code has a much larger chance of being reused. This is especially true when dealing with logic/algorithms rather than anything else (e.g. UI), but it's not exclusive to it.

### 4.1.7 Beware of cascading String concatenation
A consequence of strings being immutable is that the time to concatenate n strings is quadratic in n. The best way to avoid this is by using a  __StringBuilder__ whenever multiple concatenations are required.

### 4.1.8 Treat warning as errors
Compiler warnings can provide some additional insight and quality controls on your codebase.  They can tell you about obsolete code, unused variables, and many other items that you wouldn’t necessarily see on visual inspection.  Warnings can also surface bugs, such as possible null reference exceptions, or expressions that always evaluate to “true”.

However, compiler warnings can be easily ignored.  Ignore them for long enough, and important warnings can be lost in a sea of “acceptable” warnings. For higher quality code, warnings should always be treated with the same attention as errors.

### 4.1.9 Avoid premature optimisation
This famous aphorism is usually attributed to Donald Knuth: "Premature optimisation is the root of all evil". The general rule is: first make sure the code runs, then and _only_ then worry about how fast it runs. Clear, simple and easy to understand code is more likely to work properly and is easy to optimise, whereas complex code is hard to debug and maintain (even if it's fast).

### 4.1.10 Optimise code in the proper order
Optimisation should always start from a necessity. If the code is too slow, the best way to find the root cause is by benchmarking. After the troublesome code has been found, always optimise the _algorithmic complexity_. Avoid mini-optimisations as they seldom cause any noticeable improvements. Notable exceptions are Android-specific cases.

## 4.2 Java Style Rules

### 4.2.1 Fields Definition and Naming

Fields should be defined at the __top of the file__ and they should follow the naming rules listed below.

* Fields start with a lower case letter.
* Static final fields (constants) are ALL_CAPS_WITH_UNDERSCORES.

Example:

```java
public class MyClass {
    public static final int SOME_CONSTANT = 42;
    public int publicField;
    private static MyClass sSingleton;
    int mPackagePrivate;
    private int mPrivate;
    protected int mProtected;
}
```

### 4.2.2 Treat Acronyms as Words

| `XmlHttpRequest` | `XMLHTTPRequest` |
| `getCustomerId`  | `getCustomerID`  |
| `String url`     | `String URL`     |
| `long id`        | `long ID`        |

### 4.2.3 Use Spaces for Indentation

Use __4 space__ indents for blocks:

```java
if (x == 1) {
    x++;
}
```

Use __8 space__ indents for line wraps:

```java
Instrument i =
        someLongExpression(that, wouldNotFit, on, one, line);
```

### 4.2.4 Use Standard Brace Style

Braces go on the same line as the code before them.

```java
class MyClass {
    int func() {
        if (something) {
            // ...
        } else if (somethingElse) {
            // ...
        } else {
            // ...
        }
    }
}
```

Braces around the statements are required unless the condition and the body fit on one line.

If the condition and the body fit on one line and that line is shorter than the max line length, then braces are not required, e.g.

```java
if (condition) body();
```

This is __bad__:

```java
if (condition)
    body();  // bad!
```

### 4.2.5 Annotations

#### 4.2.5.1 Annotations Practices

According to the Android code style guide, the standard practices for some of the predefined annotations in Java are:

* `@Override`: The @Override annotation __must be used__ whenever a method overrides the declaration or implementation from a super-class. For example, if you use the @inheritdocs Javadoc tag, and derive from a class (not an interface), you must also annotate that the method @Overrides the parent class's method.

* `@SuppressWarnings`: The @SuppressWarnings annotation should only be used under circumstances where it is impossible to eliminate a warning. If a warning passes this "impossible to eliminate" test, the @SuppressWarnings annotation must be used, so as to ensure that all warnings reflect actual problems in the code.

More information about annotation guidelines can be found [here](http://source.android.com/source/code-style.html#use-standard-java-annotations).

#### 4.2.5.2 Annotations Style

__Classes, Methods and Constructors__

When annotations are applied to a class, method, or constructor, they are listed after the documentation block and should appear as __one annotation per line__ .

```java
/* This is the documentation block about the class */
@AnnotationA
@AnnotationB
public class MyAnnotatedClass { }
```

__Fields__

Annotations applying to fields should be listed __on the same line__, unless the line reaches the maximum line length.

```java
@Nullable @Mock DataManager mDataManager;
```

### 4.2.6 Limit Variable Scope

The scope of local variables should be kept to a minimum (Effective Java Item 29). By doing so, you increase the readability and maintainability of your code and reduce the likelihood of error. Each variable should be declared in the innermost block that encloses all uses of the variable._

Local variables should be declared at the point they are first used. Nearly every local variable declaration should contain an initializer. If you don't yet have enough information to initialize a variable sensibly, you should postpone the declaration until you do._ - ([Android code style guidelines](https://source.android.com/source/code-style.html#limit-variable-scope))

A consequence of this rule is that members of classes should have as narrow a visibility as possible. Fields should __never__ be public and __rarely__ be protected. Each class is responsible of its own members. By exposing its internals, it becomes unclear who is responsible for managing them. As a general rule, don't expose anything related to the implementation of a class.

### 4.2.7 Order Import Statements

If you are using an IDE such as Android Studio, you don't have to worry about this because your IDE is already obeying these rules. If not, have a look below.

The ordering of import statements is:

1. Android imports
2. Imports from third parties (com, junit, net, org)
3. java and javax
4. Same project imports

To exactly match the IDE settings, the imports should be:

* Alphabetically ordered within each grouping, with capital letters before lower case letters (e.g. Z before a).
* There should be a blank line between each major grouping (android, com, junit, net, org, java, javax).

More info [here](https://source.android.com/source/code-style.html#limit-variable-scope)

### 4.2.8 Logging Guidelines

Use the logging methods provided by the `Log` class to print out error messages or other information that may be useful for developers to identify issues:

* `Log.v(String tag, String msg)` (verbose)
* `Log.d(String tag, String msg)` (debug)
* `Log.i(String tag, String msg)` (information)
* `Log.w(String tag, String msg)` (warning)
* `Log.e(String tag, String msg)` (error)

As a general rule, we use the class name as tag and we define it as a `static final` field at the top of the file. For example:

```java
public class MyClass {
    private static final String TAG = "MyClass";

    public myMethod() {
        Log.e(TAG, "My error message");
    }
}
```

VERBOSE and DEBUG logs __must__ be disabled on release builds. It is also recommended to disable INFORMATION, WARNING and ERROR logs but you may want to keep them enabled if you think they may be useful to identify issues on release builds. If you decide to leave them enabled, you have to make sure that they are not leaking private information such as email addresses, user ids, etc.

To only show logs on debug builds:

```java
if (BuildConfig.DEBUG) Log.d(TAG, "The value of x is " + x);
```

### 4.2.9 Class Member Ordering

There is no single correct solution for this but using a __logical__ and __consistent__ order will improve code learnability and readability. It is recommendable to use the following order:

1. Constants
2. Fields
3. Constructors
4. Override methods and callbacks (public or private)
5. Public methods
6. Private methods
7. Inner classes or interfaces

Example:

```java
public class MainActivity extends Activity {

	private String mTitle;
    private TextView mTextViewTitle;

    public void setTitle(String title) {
    	mTitle = title;
    }

    @Override
    public void onCreate() {
        ...
    }

    private void setUpView() {
        ...
    }

    static class AnInnerClass {

    }

}
```

If your class is extending an __Android component__ such as an Activity or a Fragment, it is a good practice to order the override methods so that they __match the component's lifecycle__. For example, if you have an Activity that implements `onCreate()`, `onDestroy()`, `onPause()` and `onResume()`, then the correct order is:

```java
public class MainActivity extends Activity {

	//Order matches Activity lifecycle
    @Override
    public void onCreate() {}

    @Override
    public void onResume() {}

    @Override
    public void onPause() {}

    @Override
    public void onDestroy() {}

}
```

### 4.2.10 Parameter Ordering in Methods

When programming for Android, it is quite common to define methods that take a `Context`. If you are writing a method like this, then the __Context__ must be the __first__ parameter.

The opposite case are __callback__ interfaces that should always be the __last__ parameter.

Examples:

```java
// Context always goes first
public User loadUser(Context context, int userId);

// Callbacks always go last
public void loadUserAsync(Context context, int userId, UserCallback callback);
```

### 4.2.11 String Constants, Naming, and Values

Many elements of the Android SDK such as `SharedPreferences`, `Bundle`, or `Intent` use a key-value pair approach so it's very likely that even for a small app you end up having to write a lot of String constants.

When using one of these components, you __must__ define the keys as a `static final` fields and they should be prefixed as indicated below.

| Element            | Field Name Prefix |
| -----------------  | ----------------- |
| SharedPreferences  | `PREF_`             |
| Bundle             | `BUNDLE_`           |
| Fragment Arguments | `ARGUMENT_`         |
| Intent Extra       | `EXTRA_`            |
| Intent Action      | `ACTION_`           |

Note that the arguments of a Fragment - `Fragment.getArguments()` - are also a Bundle. However, because this is a quite common use of Bundles, we define a different prefix for them.

Example:

```java
// Note the value of the field is the same as the name to avoid duplication issues
static final String PREF_EMAIL = "PREF_EMAIL";
static final String BUNDLE_AGE = "BUNDLE_AGE";
static final String ARGUMENT_USER_ID = "ARGUMENT_USER_ID";

// Intent-related items use full package name as value
static final String EXTRA_SURNAME = "com.myapp.extras.EXTRA_SURNAME";
static final String ACTION_OPEN_USER = "com.myapp.action.ACTION_OPEN_USER";
```

### 4.2.12 Arguments in Fragments and Activities

When data is passed into an `Activity `or `Fragment` via an `Intent` or a `Bundle`, the keys for the different values __must__ follow the rules described in the section above.

When an `Activity` or `Fragment` expects arguments, it should provide a `public static` method that facilitates the creation of the relevant `Intent` or `Fragment`.

In the case of Activities the method is usually called `getStartIntent()`:

```java
public static Intent getStartIntent(Context context, User user) {
	Intent intent = new Intent(context, ThisActivity.class);
	intent.putParcelableExtra(EXTRA_USER, user);
	return intent;
}
```

For Fragments it is named `newInstance()` and handles the creation of the Fragment with the right arguments:

```java
public static UserFragment newInstance(User user) {
	UserFragment fragment = new UserFragment;
	Bundle args = new Bundle();
	args.putParcelable(ARGUMENT_USER, user);
	fragment.setArguments(args)
	return fragment;
}
```

__Note 1__: These methods should go at the top of the class before `onCreate()`.

__Note 2__: If we provide the methods described above, the keys for extras and arguments should be `private` because there is not need for them to be exposed outside the class.

### 4.2.13 Line Length Limit

Code lines should not exceed __100 characters__. If the line is longer than this limit there are usually two options to reduce its length:

* Extract a local variable or method (preferable).
* Apply line-wrapping to divide a single line into multiple ones.

There are two __exceptions__ where it is possible to have lines longer than 100:

* Lines that are not possible to split, e.g. long URLs in comments.
* `package` and `import` statements.

#### 4.2.13.1 Line-wrapping Strategies

There isn't an exact formula that explains how to line-wrap and quite often different solutions are valid. However there are a few rules that can be applied to common cases.

__Break at operators__

When the line is broken at an operator, the break comes __before__ the operator. For example:

```java
int longName = anotherVeryLongVariable + anEvenLongerOne - thisRidiculousLongOne
        + theFinalOne;
```

__Assignment Operator Exception__

An exception to the `break at operators` rule is the assignment operator `=`, where the line break should happen __after__ the operator.

```java
int longName =
        anotherVeryLongVariable + anEvenLongerOne - thisRidiculousLongOne + theFinalOne;
```

__Method chain case__

When multiple methods are chained in the same line - for example when using Builders - every call to a method should go in its own line, breaking the line before the `.`

```java
Picasso.with(context).load("http://example.co.uk/images/example.jpg").into(imageView);
```

```java
Picasso.with(context)
        .load("http://example.co.uk/images/example.jpg")
        .into(imageView);
```

__Long parameters case__

When a method has many parameters or its parameters are very long, we should break the line after every comma `,`

```java
loadPicture(context, "http://example.co.uk/images/example.jpg", mImageViewProfilePicture, clickListener, "Title of the picture");
```

```java
loadPicture(context,
        "http://example.co.uk/images/example.jpg",
        mImageViewProfilePicture,
        clickListener,
        "Title of the picture");
```

### 4.2.14 RxJava Chains Styling

Rx chains of operators require line-wrapping. Every operator must go in a new line and the line should be broken before the `.`

```java
public Observable<Location> syncLocations() {
    return mDatabaseHelper.getAllLocations()
            .concatMap(new Func1<Location, Observable<? extends Location>>() {
                @Override
                 public Observable<? extends Location> call(Location location) {
                     return mRetrofitService.getLocation(location.id);
                 }
            })
            .retry(new Func2<Integer, Throwable, Boolean>() {
                 @Override
                 public Boolean call(Integer numRetries, Throwable throwable) {
                     return throwable instanceof RetrofitError;
                 }
            });
}
```

## 4.3 XML Style Rules

### 4.3.1 Use Self Closing Tags

When an XML element doesn\'t have any contents, you __must__ use self closing tags.

This is good:

```xml
<TextView
	android:id="@+id/text_view_profile"
	android:layout_width="wrap_content"
	android:layout_height="wrap_content" />
```

This is __bad__ :

```xml
<!-- Don\'t do this! -->
<TextView
    android:id="@+id/text_view_profile"
    android:layout_width="wrap_content"
    android:layout_height="wrap_content" >
</TextView>
```

### 4.3.2 Resources Naming

Resource IDs and names are written in __lowercase_underscore__.
**Naming.** Follow the convention of prefixing the type, as in `type_foo_bar.xml`. Examples: `fragment_contact_details.xml`, `view_primary_button.xml`, `activity_main.xml`.

#### 4.3.2.1 ID Naming

IDs should be prefixed with the name of the element in lowercase underscore. For example:


| Element            | Prefix            |
| -----------------  | ----------------- |
| `TextView`           | `text_`             |
| `ImageView`          | `image_`            |
| `Button`             | `button_`           |
| `Menu`               | `menu_`             |

Image view example:

```xml
<ImageView
    android:id="@+id/image_profile"
    android:layout_width="wrap_content"
    android:layout_height="wrap_content" />
```

Menu example:

```xml
<menu>
	<item
        android:id="@+id/menu_done"
        android:title="Done" />
</menu>
```

#### 4.3.2.2 Strings

String names start with a prefix that identifies the section they belong to. For example `registration_email_hint` or `registration_name_hint`. If a string __doesn\'t belong__ to any section, then you should follow the rules below:


| Prefix             | Description                           |
| -----------------  | --------------------------------------|
| `error_`             | An error message                      |
| `msg_`               | A regular information message         |
| `title_`             | A title, i.e. a dialog title          |
| `action_`            | An action such as "Save" or "Create"  |

#### 4.3.2.3 Styles and Themes

Unless the rest of resources, style names are written in __UpperCamelCase__.

### 4.3.3 Organising Layouts

**Organizing layout XMLs.** If you're unsure how to format a layout XML, the following convention may help.

- One attribute per line, indented by 4 spaces
- `android:id` as the first attribute always
- `android:layout_****` attributes at the top
- `style` attribute at the bottom
- Tag closer `/>` on its own line, to facilitate ordering and adding attributes.
- Rather than hard coding `android:text`, consider using [Designtime attributes](http://tools.android.com/tips/layout-designtime-attributes) available for Android Studio.

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<LinearLayout
    xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    xmlns:tools="http://schemas.android.com/tools"
    android:layout_width="match_parent"
    android:layout_height="match_parent"
    android:orientation="vertical"
    >

    <TextView
        android:id="@+id/name"
        android:layout_width="match_parent"
        android:layout_height="wrap_content"
        android:layout_alignParentRight="true"
        android:text="@string/name"
        style="@style/FancyText"
        />

    <include layout="@layout/reusable_part" />

</LinearLayout>
```

As a rule of thumb, attributes `android:layout_****` should be defined in the layout XML, while other attributes `android:****` should stay in a style XML. This rule has exceptions, but in general works fine. The idea is to keep only layout (positioning, margin, sizing) and content attributes in the layout files, while keeping all appearance details (colors, padding, font) in styles files.

The exceptions are:

- `android:id` should obviously be in the layout files
- `android:orientation` for a `LinearLayout` normally makes more sense in layout files
- `android:text` should be in layout files because it defines content
- Sometimes it will make sense to make a generic style defining `android:layout_width` and `android:layout_height` but by default these should appear in the layout files

**Use styles.** Almost every project needs to properly use styles, because it is very common to have a repeated appearance for a view. At least you should have a common style for most text content in the application, for example:

```xml
<style name="ContentText">
    <item name="android:textSize">@dimen/font_normal</item>
    <item name="android:textColor">@color/basic_black</item>
</style>
```

Applied to TextViews:

```xml
<TextView
    android:layout_width="wrap_content"
    android:layout_height="wrap_content"
    android:text="@string/price"
    style="@style/ContentText"
    />
```

You probably will need to do the same for buttons, but don't stop there yet. Go beyond and move a group of related and repeated `android:****` attributes to a common style.

**Split a large style file into other files.** You don't need to have a single `styles.xml` file. Android SDK supports other files out of the box, there is nothing magical about the name `styles`, what matters are the XML tags `<style>` inside the file. Hence you can have files `styles.xml`, `styles_home.xml`, `styles_item_details.xml`, `styles_forms.xml`. Unlike resource directory names which carry some meaning for the build system, filenames in `res/values` can be arbitrary.

**`colors.xml` is a color palette.** There should be nothing else in your `colors.xml` than just a mapping from a color name to an RGBA value. Do not use it to define RGBA values for different types of buttons.

*Don't do just this:*

```xml
<resources>
    <color name="button_foreground">#FFFFFF</color>
    <color name="button_background">#2A91BD</color>
    <color name="comment_background_inactive">#5F5F5F</color>
    <color name="comment_background_active">#939393</color>
    <color name="comment_foreground">#FFFFFF</color>
    <color name="comment_foreground_important">#FF9D2F</color>
    ...
    <color name="comment_shadow">#323232</color>
```

You can easily start repeating RGBA values in this format, and that makes it complicated to change a basic color if needed. Also, those definitions are related to some context, like "button" or "comment", and should live in a button style, not in `colors.xml`.

Instead, consider **adding** this:

```xml
<resources>

    <!-- grayscale -->
    <color name="white">#FFFFFF</color>
    <color name="gray_light">#DBDBDB</color>
    <color name="gray">#939393</color>
    <color name="gray_dark">#5F5F5F</color>
    <color name="black">#323232</color>

    <!-- basic colors -->
    <color name="green">#27D34D</color>
    <color name="blue">#2A91BD</color>
    <color name="orange">#FF9D2F</color>
    <color name="red">#FF432F</color>
    
    <!-- this makes it easyer to change at different levels -->
    <color name="button_foreground">@color/white</color>
    <!-- ... -->

</resources>
```

Ask for this palette from the designer of the application. The names do not need to be color names as "green", "blue", etc. Names such as "brand_primary", "brand_secondary", "brand_negative" are totally acceptable as well. Formatting colors as such will make it easy to change or refactor colors, and also will make it explicit how many different colors are being used. Normally for a aesthetic UI, it is important to reduce the variety of colors being used.

**Treat dimens.xml like colors.xml.** You should also define a "palette" of typical spacing and font sizes, for basically the same purposes as for colors. A good example of a dimens file:

```xml
<resources>

    <!-- font sizes -->
    <dimen name="font_larger">22sp</dimen>
    <dimen name="font_large">18sp</dimen>
    <dimen name="font_normal">15sp</dimen>
    <dimen name="font_small">12sp</dimen>

    <!-- typical spacing between two views -->
    <dimen name="spacing_huge">40dp</dimen>
    <dimen name="spacing_large">24dp</dimen>
    <dimen name="spacing_normal">14dp</dimen>
    <dimen name="spacing_small">10dp</dimen>
    <dimen name="spacing_tiny">4dp</dimen>

    <!-- typical sizes of views -->
    <dimen name="button_height_tall">60dp</dimen>
    <dimen name="button_height_normal">40dp</dimen>
    <dimen name="button_height_short">32dp</dimen>

</resources>
```

You should use the `spacing_****` dimensions for layouting, in margins and paddings, instead of hard-coded values, much like strings are normally treated. This will give a consistent look-and-feel, while making it easier to organize and change styles and layouts.

**strings.xml**

Name your strings with keys that resemble namespaces, and don't be afraid of repeating a value for two or more keys. Languages are complex, so namespaces are necessary to bring context and break ambiguity.

**Bad**
```xml
<string name="network_error">Network error</string>
<string name="call_failed">Call failed</string>
<string name="map_failed">Map loading failed</string>
```

**Good**
```xml
<string name="error.message.network">Network error</string>
<string name="error.message.call">Call failed</string>
<string name="error.message.map">Map loading failed</string>
```

Don't write string values in all uppercase. Stick to normal text conventions (e.g., capitalize first character). If you need to display the string in all caps, then do that using for instance the attribute [`textAllCaps`](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/widget/TextView.html#attr_android:textAllCaps) on a TextView.

**Bad**
```xml
<string name="error.message.call">CALL FAILED</string>
```

**Good**
```xml
<string name="error.message.call">Call failed</string>
```

**Avoid a deep hierarchy of views.** Sometimes you might be tempted to just add yet another LinearLayout, to be able to accomplish an arrangement of views. This kind of situation may occur:

```xml
<LinearLayout
    android:layout_width="match_parent"
    android:layout_height="match_parent"
    android:orientation="vertical"
    >

    <RelativeLayout
        ...
        >

        <LinearLayout
            ...
            >

            <LinearLayout
                ...
                >

                <LinearLayout
                    ...
                    >
                </LinearLayout>

            </LinearLayout>

        </LinearLayout>

    </RelativeLayout>

</LinearLayout>
```

Even if you don't witness this explicitly in a layout file, it might end up happening if you are inflating (in Java) views into other views.

A couple of problems may occur. You might experience performance problems, because there are is a complex UI tree that the processor needs to handle. Another more serious issue is a possibility of [StackOverflowError](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2762924/java-lang-stackoverflow-error-suspected-too-many-views).

Therefore, try to keep your views hierarchy as flat as possible: learn how to use [RelativeLayout](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/layout/relative.html), how to [optimize your layouts](http://developer.android.com/training/improving-layouts/optimizing-layout.html) and to use the [`<merge>` tag](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8834898/what-is-the-purpose-of-androids-merge-tag-in-xml-layouts).

**Beware of problems related to WebViews.** When you must display a web page, for instance for a news article, avoid doing client-side processing to clean the HTML, rather ask for a "*pure*" HTML from the backend programmers. [WebViews can also leak memory](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3130654/memory-leak-in-webview) when they keep a reference to their Activity, instead of being bound to the ApplicationContext. Avoid using a WebView for simple texts or buttons, prefer TextViews or Buttons.

```java
solo.sendKey(Solo.MENU);
solo.clickOnText("More"); // searches for the first occurence of "More" and clicks on it
solo.clickOnText("Preferences");
solo.clickOnText("Edit File Extensions");
Assert.assertTrue(solo.searchText("rtf"));
```

### 4.3.4 Attributes Ordering

As a general rule you should try to group similar attributes together. A good way of ordering the most common attributes is:

1. View Id
2. Style
3. Layout width and layout height
4. Other layout attributes, sorted alphabetically
5. Remaining attributes, sorted alphabetically

### 4.3.5 Performance and Optimisations

Generally speaking, the most impactful optimisations have to do with rendering the UI properly and avoiding keeping large objects in memory wherever possible. This of course doesn't meen that other optimisations can't be noticed (obviously having a O(n^n) algorithm will block the UI at one point). 

- avoid heavy duty work in methods like draw();
- avoid calling findViewById whenever possible (the commonly used ViewHolder pattern is a standard way to avoid this problem)
- Be careful when dealing with references to UI objects: this is a common source of memory leaks
- never reference the UI from a background thread
- ensure good UI responsiveness by avoiding time-consuming work to be performed on the UI thread.
